			<p class="para-space-start">Computers are extremely proficient devices in that they help us with accomplishing more work in less time yet taking a shot at a Computers can be intense on the client's body and brain. This type of work can be stressful and can cause health issues related to brain. Stress is characterized as the bodily and intellectual reaction to intense conditions. Stress is one of the blazing issues that organizations have to deal so that employees can easily produce quality work [2].</p><br>
			<h4 class="bold-text">2.1	PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
			<p>Many researchers are of the view that stress has a negative impact on employees’ performance but at the same time researches have proved that some stressful work conditions are critical to keep employees productive [2]. Stress cannot be eliminated completely as it serves as a driving force if kept at a certain level, so stress needs to be managed [1]. The main focus of this article is to review the literature about the effects of stress and its consequence and how work stress can be managed by taking frequent short breaks in what way music helps to overcome work stress. The relevance review 
			is presented here below.</p><br>

			<h2 class="text-center bold-text">3.  3.	LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
			<br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">About Stress</h3>
			<p class="para-space">There are many definitions of stress. It is a part of both Social and concrete sciences. The stress experienced by various occupation types and employment roles has been discussed in many papers with a number of distinctive occupations being described as experiencing above average levels of stress [1]. </p>
			<p class="para-space">In another sense, Stress is a characteristic piece of life, and occurs whenever there are significant changes in humans Lives, whether the changes may be positive or negative. Not all stress is destructive. Some Stressful occasions can likewise be decent, or even advantageous, contingent upon [8].</p>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Types of Stress</h3>
			<p class="para-space">There are two different types of stress. The first type of stress is Eustress (or) Positive (or) pleasant stress. The second type of stress is Distress or Dysfunctional or negative stress [1]. </p>
			<p><span class="text-center bold-text">Positive Stress: </span>The stress responses that can be managed by an individual. That is a Positive Stress is referred as short-lived or moderate Stress responses [1].</p>
			<p><span class="text-center bold-text">Negative Stress:</span>It has negatively Bad effect on the brain. Simply, it is a type of stress that an individual cannot cope with [1]. These days’ workers are suffering from negative stress. Physical and mental health of the people is affected by Negative stress that in turn affects their work performance [12].</p><br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Causes of Stress</h3>
			<p class="para-space">Stress issue are the most well-known sort of mental sickness. Everyone has different stress triggers. But most of the people these days are affecting by the work stress. Forty percent of U.S. laborers confess to encountering office stress, and one-quarter say work is the greatest wellspring of worry in their lives [9].</p>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Causes of Work stress</h3>
			<p class="para-space">The major reasons of causing work stress in employees is workload, role conflict, and monitory inadequate reward which automatically falls down the efficiency of employee [12]. Usman Ali et al. (2014) found that workload, role conflict, and inadequate monitory reward are the main aspects of bringing about worry in representatives that prompts to decreased worker effectiveness. Subha Imtiaz and Shakil Ahmad conducted a survey, on the basis of the survey results it is seen higher work load, low acceptance for the work done, monitory inadequate reward, personal issues are causes of increasing stress levels in doctors which ultimately affected their job performance negatively. The results of the study conducted by Derek Burkland affirms that the main causes of stress among employees in Higher Education Sector are work load, role conflict and inadequate monetary rewards which automatically reduces their job performance [7]. </p><br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Consequences</h3>
			<p class="para-space">Stress is a natural phenomenon in the life and every employee even the employee at higher position such as executives and managers also be affected. Due to stress problem among employees over 100 million workdays are being affected [5].stress not only affects the employee productivity it also affects employee’s health [10]. </p><br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Outcomes of job stress</h3>
			<p class="para-space">The consequences of job stress are negative. The performance of the employee is the major thing that badly affects the organization which further leads to Absenteeism, ineffectiveness, Turnover, Job Dissatisfaction [15].</p><br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Impact of Stress on Employee Productivity, Performance and Turnover</h3>
			<p class="para-space">Stress is a Global issue. It has become a very natural phenomenon of routine life, and an unavoidable consequence of the ways in which society has changed. This change has occurred in all the fields. These days’ persons from nearly every walk of life are facing stress. Especially, employers today are critically analyzing the stress management issues that add to lower work performance of employee originating from dissatisfaction &high turnover eventually affecting organizational goals and objectives [6].There are many researches and survey proving that employee stress has a major role on company and employee performance. A survey conducted on the employee’s working in medical field results that due to rising stress levels in doctors, which ultimately affected their job performance negatively [9]. A review & research has proposed a model in which they takes the relationship between employee stress and job performance and they have found a negative relationship between job stress and job performance [2].A survey directed as of late uncovered that 66% of Canadian CEOs studied conceded that stress is currently the greatest deplete confronting corporate-Canada, and is in certainty accomplishing more harm to profitability than whatever else in the work environment [8].</p><br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Coping with Stress at Work</h3>
			<p class="para-space">Technological improvements have decreased the measure of overwhelming physical work.
	 		Mental and emotional strain have extended in new workplaces [11]. At the point when the brain 
	 		is familiar with stress, a physical response is activated and it effectively harms the memory, which
			may prompt to advance mental responses or misconduct [16]. When stress affects the brain with 
	 		its many nerve associations, even the rest of the body feels the impact. Individuals require help to
			recognize measures that can provoke to long haul advantage. Coping strategies are known to im-
			pact a people's experience of stress [11].</p><br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Relaxation at Work</h3>
			<p class="para-space">Relaxation techniques are an awesome approach to help with stress management. Relaxation isn't just about peace of mind or enjoying a hobby. Relaxation is a procedure that lower the impacts of stress on one’s mind and body. Relaxation techniques can help you cope with everyday stress and with stress related to various medical issues. There are many effective ways of dealing with work stress. They are Deep breathing, Progressive relaxation, Small, frequent breaks are more relaxing than fewer, A few deep breaths with slow exhaling can neutralize a quick stress response or fit of anxiety, longer breaks (for one hour after four hours of persistent work), Small physical activities are helpful for computer users [11], Taking a cup of coffee and many other ways. Usually working people prefer to take a coffee as their stress relief, but Caffeine is a stimulant that simulates the stress response and can make people hyper. It better to completely avoid the Coffee or keeping consumption down to three cups is recommended [8]. One of the very best ways to relax your mind is by listening music [21].</p><br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Brief and Rare Mental Breaks Keeps Employee Focused</h3><br>
			<h3 class=" bold-text">Work breaks</h3>
			<p class="para-space"> Work breaks or a limited time period which the worker does not need to have to exhaust the vitality on work-related tasks [23].</p>
			<p>Taking breaks from work is a basic and widespread practice [23]. There are many earlier studies that evidence that micro- breaks, benefits employee work performance. A study earlier by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign proved that taking frequent breaks is good for individual productivity, focus, and creativity [5]. Earlier research by University of Wisconsin-Stout, has explored how worker productivity and focus is affected by breaks. Breaks improve overall work performance, despite the short-term cost to productivity and overhead of task resumption [19]. Recently, the Draggier Group, a social networking company found in an experiment that the top 10% of employees with the highest productivity were taking regular breaks. Employees with the highest levels of productivity worked for 52 minutes with intense purpose, then rested up, allowing their purpose, then rested up, allowing their brain time to rejuvenate and prepare for the next work period. Other work has studied about 
			the micro breaks or micro diversions that is nothing but second or minute- long breaks from work, and its impact on work  [13], [20], [17]. These rests have been appearing to enhance productivity [17] and increment employee maintenance in group fueled frameworks [13]. Prior Work (The Booster Break Program, 2010) has displayed that regular breaks lowers physical discomfort and accidents in industrial environments [14], [18].
			</p><br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Effects of Relaxing Music on Salivary Cortisol</h3>
			<p class="para-space">Cortisol is a hormone that is released during stress and can be used to measure stress [3], [4]. Music listening has been recommended to valuably impact health by means of stress-decreasing impacts [21]. Music is a effective tool in invoking emotions [3]. Music may also serve as an anxiolytic treatment, that is, a stress preventative or stress diminishing measure. Since music is quipped for producing positive feelings and lifting individual spirits, these effects can be potentially used in clinical zones to reduce pain and anxiety [22]. Supportive evidence can be found in the observation that listening to music resulted in a marked reduction in salivary cortisol levels. Music listening affected the psychobiological stress framework. Listening to music affects nervous system and relaxes the endocrine and mental stress. It creates the impression that listening to music has the natural capacity to decrease the psychobiological stretch response [21]. A study (Myriam V. Thoma, 2013) showed that listening to music can help control the Cortisol levels. Hence, survey suggest that listening to music is a way to control stress [3], [4].</p><br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Stress applications</h3>
			<p class="para-space space">There are many stress control apps available in market which relax people mind and 
			Body. But most of these applications are mobile apps they mainly focus on exercise and Diet. Stress breaker is a desktop application which mainly focus on decreasing the stress level by taking regular breaks and listening to music.</p>

			<h2 class="text-center bold-text">4.	METHODOLOGY</h2><br>
			<p class="para-space">In simple terms, methodology is nothing but a system of methods used to develop Application.</p>
			<p>The main goal of these methodologies is to make the process more predictable and efficient [24].</p><br>
			<h2 class=" bold-text">Software Development Process Model (SDLC)
			</h2>
			<p>It is a process of creating or altering information systems, mythologies and models [25]. The Software Development Process Model used to develop this Application is <span class=" bold-text">LINEAR-SEQUENTIAL LIFE CYCLE MODEL.</span> It is also referred to as a Waterfall Model. In recent times, the prominent methodological approaches for developing software for a computer based information system are the popular traditional linear-sequential life cycle model [26]. As the name itself specifies that the Application development process will be in linear sequential flow. Waterfall model uses a linear approach and is suitable for sequential or procedural design.
			Fowler [27] confirms that waterfall model divides application based on activities: requirement analysis, design, coding and testing. In "The Waterfall" approach, complete process of Application development is divided into separate phases. Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases. The phases involved in waterfalls model are five and they are analysis, design, implementation, testing and operation and maintenance [26].</p><br>

			<h3 class="bold-text">Implementation </h3>
			This phase is concerned with the physical construction of the software as set out in the design stage.
			<h3 class="bold-text">Software requirements needed to develop this application are 
			Programming language</h3>
			<p>Python was chosen for the development of this Application Python 3.5 is used in implementing the code for this application. Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language [30] [31] [32]. It is fast and powerful programming language and it is portable. Python scripts can be used on different operating systems such as: Windows, Linux, UNIX, Amigo, Mac OS, etc. Python is open source .Even though all rights of this program are reserved for the Python institute, but it is open source and there is no limitation in using, changing and distributing [29].</p>
			<br>
			<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Constraint Requirements</h3><br>
			<p class="para-space">GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI) This application is designed using python graphical User Interface (GUI) named Tkinter. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Tkinter is a standard interface that is distributed with Python interpreter. It provides the essential tools for designing GUI. Generated GUIs are in pmw format and they have a similar look on the different platforms. Tkinter are the basic interfaces for designing GUIs in Python [29].</p>
			<h3 class=" bold-text">Pygame Module</h3>
			<p class="para-space">In python programs, code normally contains functions and variables. So when the user quit from our interpreter, all definitions are lost. As user codes get longer, it gets very inconvenient to redefine all the values for variables. To solve this problem, the user has a solution: To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a Script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module. Module: A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements [33].</p>
			<p>Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing games and multimedia. It is highly portable and can run nearly every platform and operating system [33]. In this Application Pygame feature are used for playing songs. It contains an excellent function for controlling streamed audio. The music module is closely tied to Pygame mixer. Here downloaded mp3 songs are converted into the OGG because mp3 support is limited. On some systems an unsupported format can crash the program [34].</p>
			<h3 class=" bold-text">	Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h3>
			<p class="para-space">IDE used to develop this Application is Pycharm. It is one of the integrated development environment (IDE) used in python programming language. Programming code used to develop this application is interpreted in Pycharm.</p><br>
			<h3 class=" bold-text">Installation process:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Download python 3.5 from python official website www.python.org based on user operating system</li>
				<li>Install it on users system</li>
				<li>Download pygame from python binaries Location [35].</li>
				<li>Go to python IDLE folder and then scripts and paste the pygame files in that location</li>
				<li>Go to command prompt type PIP"space install space pygame version</li>
				<li>pygame is successfully installed n users computer</li>
				<li>Go to Pycharm official website [36] and download Pycharm and install it.

				</li></ol><br>
				<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Integration and Testing</h3><br><p>
				After the implementation phase the coding is tested by using pycharm debugger and interpreter.</p>
				<h3 class="text-center bold-text">Maintenance</h3>
				<p class="para-space">After the delivery of the Application, a schedule maintenance and support is put into place, to ensure the Application continues to work as designed. </p><br>
				<h3 class=" bold-text">ACCURACY AND PRECISION </h3>
				Since this is a desktop application there is less percentage of failure.
				<h3 class=" bold-text">Cost</h3>
				<p>This application is inexpensive to develop because the main requirements, develop this application that is python, pygame are open sourced. They can be downloaded for free from their official website.</p>
				<h3 class=" bold-text">Usability </h3>
				<p>This application is easy to use. Look and feel standards: Pycharm provides many keyboard shortcuts to run the Application <br>F5 – To run the python Application in python (IDLE)<br>
				Alt+Shift+F10-To run the python Application in Pycharm <br>
				Alt+Shift+F9-To debug python Application in Pycharm.<br></p>
				<h3 class=" bold-text">Modifiability </h3>
				<p>One good thing about python Tkinter is it has many GUI properties available that make the application even more attractive and efficient. Extra GUI properties that can be added to this application is color texts, scroll bar, bold text and many other features.</p>
				<h3 class=" bold-text">Response time </h3>
				<p>The response time depends on the user choice. Since, this an alert application which breaks the employee stress. The response time depends on the time set by the user. For example, if the user wish to have breaks for every 50 minutes. Then the response time of the application would be 50 minutes. That is after every 50mintues a pop up box will be displayed specifying the user to take breaks and listen the music of his choice.</p>
				<h3 class=" bold-text">Activity Diagram</h3>
				Activity diagram is basically a flow chart to represent the flow from one activity to 
				another activity.
				<img  class=" img-responsive img-style" src="flow-img.PNG">
				<h3 class=" bold-text">Processing time</h3>
				<p>The processing time for this application is quick. When the user click the listen music button with in no time delay it automatically opens the folder window so that user can select music folder. When the user selects music folder, it imports all the songs from the music folder and display on the playlist. Overall performance time to run this application less than half minute, which is a very short time.</p>
				<h3 class=" bold-text">Advantage</h3>
				The main benefit of using a waterfall model in developing stress Breaker Applications is it is inexpensive and quick.
